# Progress

Task status and coherence checks. The backlog itself is generated from the spec
([90-backlog.md](spec/90-backlog.md)); this file records what is done and verified.
`make docs` validates that every task ID below exists in the spec.

Statuses: `done` (merged, done-when met) · `in review` (PR open) · `in progress` · `partial` (merged,
part of the done-when still open) · `not started`.

## Follow-ups from wave 1

Open questions for the owner:

- ARC.7: confirm the choice values for tax_regime, commission_vat_mode and einvoice_channel with the tax advisor.
- ARC.7: may staff configure a PlatformOperator row that starts in the past? The service allows it today.
- ARC.7: should a future platform_entity FK (VEN.4, VEN.6) point to a configuration version row or to a stable legal entity key?
- VEN.1: confirm the extra status transitions (suspended to active, closing from any open status).
- VEN.1: should the vendor slug become read-only after creation?
- CORE.6: confirm that key authentication logic may live in apps/api, and record it in spec 01.
- CORE.6: confirm that rotation revokes the old key at once with no grace period, and record it in spec 02.
- CORE.6: track the ApiClient.vendor FK migration under VEN.1 or CORE.3? VEN.1 is now merged.

Deferred to other tasks:

- ARC.7: the EUR 10,000 distance-sales threshold goes to TAX.2; the tax context snapshot dataclass goes to TAX.3.
- ARC.7: no PlatformOperator row is seeded, so current_operator() fails until ARC.10 or the go-live checklist adds one.
- ARC.9: job retention cleanup and alerts on queue depth and failed jobs go to the OPS monitoring tasks.
- ARC.9: Heartbeat has no admin page yet. The worker container is resolved by ARC.5 (#13).
- ARC.9: human review requested for _BusinessTimePeriodicTask and on_app_ready, which use undocumented Procrastinate attributes.
- VEN.1: plan, payout_account, dac7_complete and logo fields wait for VEN.2, VEN.6, CMP.1 and the media stack.
- VEN.1: translation workflow status and source_hash go to I18N.2.
- VEN.1, CORE.6: client IP comes from REMOTE_ADDR; behind the reverse proxy it must come from the trusted proxy header (OPS, ARC.5).
- CORE.6: per-client rate limit and logging of mutating API calls go to CORE.7; key issuing admin goes to CORE.8.
- SEC.1: PAY tasks must allow the payment feature and add the payment provider sources to the CSP; CORE.5 needs the same for the captcha.
- SEC.1: __Host- cookie prefixes, CORP/COEP headers and a CSP report endpoint are not done yet.
- SEC.1: the CSRF cookie is HttpOnly, so front-end code must read the token from the page.

Review findings not fixed (all minor):

- ARC.7: history rows are immutable only in Python; QuerySet.update() and re-closing a closed row bypass the guard.
- ARC.7: concurrent configure_platform_operator calls end in a raw IntegrityError instead of a ValidationError.
- ARC.7: dac7_authority_country accepts non-EU countries.
- ARC.7: PlatformOperator.EInvoiceChannel shares its name with the CMP.2 EInvoiceChannel interface.
- ARC.7: current_operator() raises TypeError on a naive datetime instead of a clear error.
- ARC.9: the heartbeat worker test asserts on the whole log text, so Procrastinate's own log lines satisfy it.
- ARC.9: no test shows that rolling back the caller's transaction drops an enqueued job.
- ARC.9: record_heartbeat is a mutating service without dry_run or ChangeSet, and the exception is not recorded in the spec.
- ARC.9: run_worker(scheduler=False) swaps the global periodic task registry; safe only in tests.
- ARC.9: a local test run warned that the test database was still in use at teardown.
- VEN.1: admin create, edit and delete of vendor legal and tax data write no AuditLog.
- VEN.1: bulk "move to closed" has no confirmation step.
- VEN.1: VendorTranslation.language choices are frozen in the migration, so adding a language needs a migration.
- VEN.1: the make_vendor test helper copied into three test modules is resolved by ARC.12 (#16).
- VEN.1: two concurrent vendor creates with the same name fail on the slug instead of getting a suffix.
- CORE.6: allowed_ips is a CharField array, not InetAddress as in spec 02, and stored values are not validated.
- CORE.6: the key format regex has no upper bound on secret length.
- CORE.6: issuing or rotating a key with a naive expires_at raises TypeError instead of InvalidApiClient.
- CORE.6: rotate and revoke check is_active on a stale instance without select_for_update.
- SEC.1: SECURE_REDIRECT_EXEMPT for /healthz is out of scope and belongs with the OPS.2 probe design.
- SEC.1: the strict CSP needs the Alpine.js CSP build and htmx without indicator styles or hx-on; note it for front-end tasks.
- SEC.1: no test covers a view that sets its own Permissions-Policy.
- SEC.1: a mixed Permissions-Policy allowlist such as ["*", "self"] emits an invalid quoted "*".

## Follow-ups from wave 2

Open questions for the owner:

- ARC.5: choose the hosting provider (price, EU region, managed PostgreSQL 17 with PITR) and record it as ADR-0005 requires.
- ARC.5: either provision STAGE and run a real tag deploy, rollback and unhealthy deploy, or narrow the done-when and add a new spec 01 row for the STAGE deploy.
- I18N.1: should `/` redirect signed-in users to their preferred language prefix? Today it always serves EN.

Deferred to other tasks:

- ARC.5: there is no automatic deploy from CI to STAGE; deploys run by hand with mpmv-deploy until a host and SSH secrets exist.
- ARC.5: release images are built only for linux/amd64; an arm64 server needs a multi-platform build.
- ARC.5: rollback does not undo migrations, so migrations must stay compatible with the previous release (expand, then contract).
- ARC.5: media has no writable location on STAGE/LIVE (read-only root, no volume); it needs an object storage backlog row before CAT.4 and SEC.2.
- I18N.1: the staff admin is always in EN, because unprefixed paths use the primary language.
- I18N.1: page strings are marked for translation, but .po/.mo catalogs come with I18N.5.
- I18N.1: hreflang, canonical and sitemaps go to I18N.6; wagtail-localize goes to I18N.3.
- I18N.1: the "/it/ and /de/ active on STAGE" check needs a smoke test once STAGE exists.

Review findings not fixed (all minor):

- I18N.1: User.preferred_language choices are frozen in the migration (coherence check 2, finding 1).
- ARC.5: concurrent deploy or rollback runs are not locked and can corrupt the release history.
- ARC.5: the release workflow publishes an image for any v*.*.* tag without checking that the commit is on main with green CI.
- ARC.5: WhiteNoise runs before the CSP and Permissions-Policy middleware, so static responses carry neither header.
- ARC.5: .dockerignore patterns for .env and key files match only at the root of the build context.
- ARC.5: the Caddy unit does not drop capabilities, and Caddy has no trusted_proxies for Cloudflare, so the app sees Cloudflare IPs.
- ARC.5: the implementation commit changed a parser in the test-only commit.

## Coherence checks

Run at least every 5 completed tasks: code vs spec and ADRs, done-when criteria, docs drift,
anonymization, `make check`, `make test`, `make test-e2e`.

### Check 1 (2026-11-07, after ARC.11, ARC.4, ARC.6, CORE.1)

| Area | Result |
|---|---|
| Done-when criteria | Met for all four tasks; CI green on #1–#3; #4 pending re-run |
| Spec 01 conventions | Money (Decimal, ROUND_HALF_UP per line, 4-dp internals, EUR), ISO countries (GR not EL), `public_id` UUID, dry-run `ChangeSet`, `AuditLog` (who/what/before/after/where): implemented as specified |
| ADRs | 0001 versions match `uv.lock`; 0002 local DB on Apple `container`; 0004 not yet used (ARC.9); 0006 suites in place |
| App dependency graph | import-linter contracts kept (2/2) |
| Anonymization | No vendor names, legacy identifiers or hostnames in new code; test credentials generated at runtime |
| Docs drift | README status line was stale ("empty shells") → fixed |

Findings and actions:

1. **Audit log and TRUNCATE.** The trigger blocks UPDATE/DELETE, but TRUNCATE stays allowed because
   the test runner flushes tables with it. Added to OPS.1: the application DB role must not have
   TRUNCATE or DDL rights.
2. **Secret scanners flag test literals.** GitGuardian and gitleaks flagged a throwaway CI database
   password and literal test passwords. CI and local databases now use trust auth (bound to
   localhost), and tests generate passwords with `secrets`. The rule is in CLAUDE.md.
3. **A commit was pushed with a failing type check** (fixed in the next commit). Rule: run
   `make check` before committing, not only before the PR.
4. **Parallel test runs collide on one test database.** Added `MPMV_TEST_DB_NAME`, used by
   parallel agents.

### Check 2 (2026-11-07, after ARC.7, ARC.9, VEN.1, CORE.6, SEC.1)

Scope: main at a807dbc. Code against spec chapters 01, 02, 04, 09 and 12 and ADRs 0003, 0004;
spec against spec; repo hygiene.

| Area | Result |
|---|---|
| Done-when criteria | Met for all five tasks: no platform country literal (guard test), heartbeat job scheduled and observable, vendor admin CRUD and status tests, 401/403 for expired, revoked and out-of-scope keys, header scan test. CI green on main |
| Spec 01 conventions | Logic in `services.py` and `engine.py`; engines import no ORM. Mutating services (`configure_platform_operator`, `change_status`, issue, rotate and revoke key) take `dry_run` and return a `ChangeSet` through `run_mutation`, which writes `AuditLog`. No money fields yet |
| ADRs | 0003 respected (nothing built that it delegates). 0004: Procrastinate only behind `apps.core.tasks`, wrapper offers `task`, `enqueue`, `periodic`, `locked` |
| App dependency graph | import-linter 3/3 kept: layers now cover vendors and api, Procrastinate contract, tax and shipping independence |
| Spec vs spec | `make docs-check` green. No open decision (D-xx) blocks a merged task or is decided by code |
| Scope creep | None found. Fields owned by later tasks (plan, payout_account, dac7_complete, logo, ApiClient.vendor) are left out |
| Anonymization | No real vendor names, legacy order numbers or hostnames; no credential-like literals (test keys and passwords are generated) |
| Migrations | One leaf per app; `makemigrations --check` clean |
| Gates | `make check` green; `make test` 316 passed; `make test-e2e` 5 passed |

Findings and actions:

1. Major. Language choices are frozen in migrations. `User.preferred_language` (CORE.1) and
   `VendorTranslation.language` (VEN.1) use `choices=settings.LANGUAGES`, so adding a language
   needs a new migration, while spec 09 says adding a language never needs code changes. Every
   future `*Translation` model would copy this. Action: use a callable for the choices (Django
   serializes the reference, not the list) before more translation tables exist; take it with
   I18N.1 or I18N.2.
2. Major. Spec 12 reuses task IDs for requirements. §12.3 numbers requirements SEC.1 to SEC.10,
   while §12.6 numbers tasks SEC.0 to SEC.3 with other meanings (requirement SEC.1 is the access
   model, task SEC.1 is HTTP hardening; requirement SEC.3 is HTTP hardening, task SEC.3 is
   field-level encryption). "SEC.1 done" can be misread. `make docs-check` only reads task tables,
   so it does not catch this. Not changed here: it is a spec table edit (owner question 5).
3. Minor. Staff manage vendors and the platform operator through the Django admin, while spec 02
   keeps the Django admin for the technical superuser on a restricted network and puts staff in
   Wagtail ViewSets. Acceptable until CORE.8; CORE.8 should take these screens over, and the
   restricted network rule needs an ARC.5 or OPS item.
4. Minor. "engine.py has no ORM" is a convention only. Action: add an import-linter contract
   that forbids `django.db` in `apps.*.engine` (a small ARC.4 follow-up).
5. Minor. `ApiClient.vendor` (spec 02) is still missing although VEN.1 is merged. The wave 1
   question on which task owns it stays open.
6. Minor. The "test database still in use" teardown warning did not come back in four local runs
   of `make test` on main. It appeared once on the ARC.9 branch before its review fixes. The likely
   source is a Procrastinate worker connection left open by an interrupted run, but this is not
   confirmed. `run_worker` and `defer_periodic` open and close their own pool. No action; reopen
   if it shows up again.

Owner questions:

1. SEC.1: live settings send HSTS for one year with includeSubDomains and preload. Confirm that
   every subdomain of the production domain will be HTTPS only before anyone submits the domain to
   the preload list.
2. CORE.6: a valid key used from an address outside its allow-list gets 403, not 401. Confirm.
3. VEN.1: closed is terminal, and a rejected application becomes closed (no separate rejected
   status, no reopening). Confirm.
4. ARC.9: the default retry policy (5 retries, backoff from 30 s doubling up to 1 h) and the
   heartbeat every 5 minutes without retries were chosen in code. Confirm, or tune them with the
   OPS alerting tasks.
5. Spec 12: may we rename the §12.3 requirement IDs (for example SR-1 to SR-10) so they no longer
   collide with task IDs?
